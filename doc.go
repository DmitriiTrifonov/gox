/*
Package gox is a minimalistic, lightweight extension to Go.
It contains constants, helpers and utilities which could have been part of Go itself.

The package is minimalistic, and introduces no dependencies to any package.
Most of the functions are eligible for inlining.

Reasonable to "dot-import" the package so identifiers will be directly available,
see the package example.
