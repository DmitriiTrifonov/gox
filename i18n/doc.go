/*

Package i18n contains internationalization and localization utilities.

Translations are handled by the Dict type and its Get method, which is captured
by the Translator type. Dict presents a very compact and efficient translation
modelling, while presenting the flexibility of a map.

Locales must be modeled with integers, where 0 denotes your default, fallback locale.
